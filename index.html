            <h3> Serbian-American inventor, electrical engineer,
                 mechanical engineer</h3>
            <h1 class="name">Nikola Tesla</h1>
            <p class="descr" >Born and raised in the Austrian
                 Empire, Tesla studied engineering and physics 
                 in the 1870s without receiving a degree, 
                 gaining practical experience in the early
                  1880s working in telephony and at Continental 
                  Edison in the new electric power industry.
                   In 1884 he emigrated to the United States,
                    where he became a naturalized citizen.
                     He worked for a short time at the
                      Edison Machine Works in New York City
                       before he struck out on his own.
                        With the help of partners to finance
                         and market his ideas, Tesla set up 
                         laboratories and companies in New York
                          to develop a range of electrical and
                           mechanical devices.

                    <li class="work-duties">In 1887, Tesla developed an induction motor that ran on alternating
                         current (AC), a power system format that was rapidly expanding
                          in Europe and the United States because of its advantages
                           in long-distance, high-voltage transmission.

                          Tesla introduced his steam powered reciprocating electricity 
                          generator that he patented that year, something he thought
                           was a better way to generate alternating current.

                    <li class="work-duties">In 1898, Tesla demonstrated a boat that used a coherer -based radio 
                        control —which he dubbed "telautomaton"—to the public during an electrical exhibition 
                        at Madison Square Garden .</li>
